# MaineSnowReport
This will give updates on Sunday River and Sugar Loaf ski resort snowfall (updating every hour).

I used BeautifulSoup to scrape the websites snowfall: 
https://www.sundayriver.com/mountain-report
https://www.sugarloaf.com/mountain-report

I used Flask, HTML, CSS, BootStrap to create the website.

I used apscheduler to create a BackgroundScheduler to run the webscraper every hour.
